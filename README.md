# Manh Nguyen Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This website serves as a portfolio of my work and a platform to share my thoughts and experiences with the world. The website is built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion, and is designed to be responsive and easy to navigate.

## My Role

I designed and developed my personal website myself, using my skills as a web developer and designer.

## Lessons Learned

Through the development of this portfolio, I gained valuable technical skills in front-end web development using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. I also learned the importance of planning and setting realistic goals at the beginning of the project. Unexpected challenges, such as limited icon availability and the need for additional pages, taught me to be adaptable and flexible in my approach. In the end, this project provided a great learning experience for both technical skills and project management. It has prepared me for future projects by teaching me the importance of planning, adaptability, and continuous improvement.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
