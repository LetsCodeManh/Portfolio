        <h1>Hi, I'm Manh Nguyen!</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a young entrepreneur, designer, and developer always looking for
          new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
        </p>
        <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
        <p>
          - after graduating high school, I completed an apprenticeship as a
          technical product designer and worked in the same company for an
          additional year. However, my thirst for more challenges led me to
          create my own company where I tried out new things and businesses.
          After a while, I decided to pursue the path of a developer and
          enrolled in a bootcamp. Now, I've just finished my bootcamp and am
          eager to apply my knowledge and grow even further.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to audiobooks, reading and
          learning new skills, meditating, and cooking. Cooking is one of my
          passions - there's nothing better than having good food on the table!
        </p>
        <p>
          As an INTJ-A personality type, I'm analytical, strategic, and always
          seeking knowledge. I'm driven by a desire to understand how things
          work and find solutions to complex problems.
